## Hi there 👋

**Open Modbus** is an open-source initiative focused on creating reliable, fully transparent hardware and firmware for Modbus-based automation systems.  
Our projects include digital/analog I/O modules, STM32-based controllers, and tools for building distributed RS-485 networks.

## What We Provide
- Open hardware (schematics, PCB, BOM)
- Open firmware (Modbus RTU, STM32)
- Documentation and wiring guides
- Ready-to-use industrial I/O modules (e.g., **OM-64DO**)

## Get Started
Explore our repositories — each includes build files, Modbus maps, and examples.  
Recommended starting point: **OM-64DO**, a 64-channel low-side output module.

## Contributing
We welcome improvements, bug reports, and new device ideas.  
See each project's `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines.

## Support
Use GitHub Issues for questions or problems.
